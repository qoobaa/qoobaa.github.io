    <h3>Strobe</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/01/strobe-launches-game-changing-html5-app-platform/">
        The Strobe platform was launched in September 2011
      </a>,
      aiming to empower developers in creating HTML5 applications for desktops, smartphones, and tablets.
      The primary objective of the platform was to offer a <strong>comprehensive suite of tools for building, deploying, and hosting web applications</strong>.
      My involvement with the team began in June 2011, where I contributed to integrating the platform with social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.
      I had the privilege of working alongside a <strong>remarkable team</strong> consisting of individuals like
      <a href="https://github.com/wycats">Yehuda Katz</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/carllerche">Carl Lerche</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/josevalim">Jos&#233; Valim</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/wagenet">Peter Wagenet</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/drogus">Piotr Sarnacki</a>,
      and many other talented individuals.
      In November 2011, the platform was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/08/facebook-acquires-html5-app-delivery-network-strobe-sproutcore-lives-on/">acquired by Facebook</a>.

      frontend. The platform harnesses cutting-edge technologies, including convolutional neural networks,
      to deliver an accurate method for diagnosing various skin conditions.
