          <strong>Fakturama</strong><br>
          Developed a proof of
          concept SPA application for invoicing, written
          in <em>Ember</em> utilizing
          <em>Firebase</em> for authentication and storage, <em>Yahoo!
          Pipes</em> for fetching the data unavailable through
          API. The app is a purely client-side application that runs
          without a single line of server-side code and nearly 10
          years later it's still fully usable.

          <strong>sqlite3 gem</strong><br>

          Initiated development of a new sqlite3 library, fixing
          compatibility with Ruby 1.9, introducing character
          encodings. The initial work used <em>FFI</em> bindings and
          it got some traction in <em>JRuby</em> community. It's been
          eventually replaced by Aaron Patterson with the C-extension
          gem.
