          <strong>Fakturama</strong><br>
          Developed a proof of concept for an invoicing Single Page
          Application (SPA) that showcased the potential of modern
          frontend technologies. The client-side-only application was
          built using Ember, with Firebase for authentication and
          storage, and Yahoo! Pipes for fetching data not available
          through APIs. The project demonstrated the longevity and
          efficiency of the SPA, as it remains fully functional after
          an extended period without any server-side code
          dependencies.

          <strong>sqlite3 gem</strong><br>
          Initiated the development of a new sqlite3 library,
          addressing compatibility issues with Ruby 1.9 and
          introducing character encodings. The initial work leveraged
          FFI bindings and gained traction within the JRuby
          community. Although eventually replaced by Aaron Patterson's
          C-extension gem, the project served as a valuable step in
          advancing sqlite3 library development and promoting
          compatibility with newer Ruby versions.

          Developed a fully functional library to access European S3
          buckets, filling a gap in the market as other Ruby libraries
          at the time did not offer support for this feature. With
          over 3 million downloads, the gem continues to be widely
          used, demonstrating its lasting impact and value to the Ruby
          development community.
